Stripe Integration

* Javascript should prevent pro form from submitting, when user fills it out,
and should sen card info to Stripe. Stripe will return with a card toekn. @users.js
* Jacascript should send user fields and card token to our rails app for 
validation. Rails app should validate the user fields. Rails app will note 
whether plan 1 or plan 2 (basic or pro).
* Once validated, Rails should send user info (email, plan id) and card token to
Stripe server, and Stripe will create a subscription and send back a customer
token. Rails should save customer token and user information to our db.
